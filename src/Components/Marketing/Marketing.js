        Thanks to technology, customers interact with brands in ways that were
        not even imagined just a few short years ago. One-directional
        advertising though static media channels guided customer relationships.
        Interactions today are complex and multi-directional. The customer has a
        voice in establishing the relationship- and will also use that voice to
        communicate to others through mobile and social media channels.

        The bottom line is all about engaging the customer. The customer
        relationship has become the greatest company asset. Stronger customer
        relationships are forged through thoughtful use of marketing analytics.
        In this age of the customer, empowered buyers erase traditional
        competitive advantages. You want to take action on deep customer
        knowledge before your competitor does while avoiding the shiny
        temptation of marketing only to things, such as channels, devices and
        technology.
